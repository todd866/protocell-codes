We propose that symbolic codes first emerged as coordination interfaces between coupled protocellular compartments, not as transmitted messages requiring pre-existing encoder-decoder machinery. Using a minimal model of weakly coupled chemical compartments with high-dimensional internal dynamics and multi-channel boundary signaling, we demonstrate that discrete, reproducible symbol sequences arise spontaneously from coordination equilibria. The key mechanism is substrate competition (lateral inhibition), which discretizes continuous dynamics without external logic. Our simulations show that networks of 19--61 coupled compartments reliably map 32 environmental configurations to 32 unique 4-symbol sequences with 100\% reproducibility, and a physics-based receiver colony decodes these with 100\% accuracy. We argue that this ``codes as coordination'' framework resolves the apparent paradox of abiogenesis: information does not arise \textit{de novo} from chemistry, but rather emerges when coherent coordination dynamics collapse into reproducible invariants. Communication precedes information storage. The genetic code is not the origin of biological meaning---it is the compression of meaning that first existed in the distributed coupling fields between cells.

\section{Introduction: The Code Emergence Problem}
%==============================================================================

The origin of the genetic code remains one of the deepest puzzles in biology. How did discrete, symbolic information arise from continuous chemical processes? Standard accounts assume that codes require encoders, messages, and decoders---but this raises a circularity problem: how can encoding machinery exist before the code that specifies it?

We propose a resolution: \textbf{codes first emerged as coordination interfaces between coupled protocellular compartments}. They were not transmitted messages but stable patterns that allowed neighbors to influence each other's behavior without full state knowledge.

This reframing dissolves the circularity. The ``code'' is not something one compartment sends to another. It is the shared equilibrium that emerges when coupled systems settle into mutually compatible states. The encoder-message-decoder structure we recognize in mature biological systems is a \textit{late refinement}---the internalization and compression of coordination protocols that first existed in the distributed coupling fields between cells.

This work builds on recent results establishing fundamental limits on observation and control in high-dimensional biological systems. Todd \cite{todd2025falsifiability} showed that measurement thresholds create irreducible uncertainty in sub-Landauer regimes; Todd \cite{todd2025timing} demonstrated that timing constraints limit accessible information in continuous substrates; and Todd \cite{todd2026intelligence} proved that when high-dimensional dynamics ($H_{\text{dyn}}$) exceed observer channel capacity ($C_{\text{obs}}$), stable codes \textit{must} form as a thermodynamic necessity. The present paper provides a concrete physical demonstration of this code formation mechanism.

\subsection{Outline}

Section~\ref{sec:framework} develops the theoretical framework: codes as coordination equilibria, the group-first hypothesis, and the evolutionary sequence from coupled dynamics to genetic compression. Section~\ref{sec:vesicles} addresses prebiotic plausibility, arguing that lipid vesicle networks are the minimal substrate satisfying all requirements for code emergence. Section~\ref{sec:architecture} presents our physical model and simulation results. Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses implications for abiogenesis, artificial life, and the philosophy of biology.

%==============================================================================
\section{Theoretical Framework}
\label{sec:framework}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Codes Are Coordination Equilibria}

Consider a network of weakly coupled protocells:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each protocell has high-dimensional internal dynamics (many coupled molecular species)
    \item Neighbors communicate through \textbf{multiple channels}: bioelectric (ion gradients, membrane potential), chemical (pH, metabolites), mechanical (membrane tension), and redox signaling
    \item These signals are naturally discretized by threshold physics (voltage-gated transitions, precipitation, phase changes)
    \item Selection favors configurations where neighbors reliably respond to each other's boundary states
\end{itemize}

This multi-channel architecture provides redundancy, cross-validation, and temporal separation (fast electrical, slow chemical) \cite{bhattacharya2019neural,perbal2003communication}. Levin and colleagues have demonstrated that bioelectric patterns carry morphogenetic ``codes'' in biological development---voltage gradients that specify tissue identity \cite{levin2021bioelectric,levin2012molecular,adams2016endogenous}. We propose this is not a derived feature of complex life but a \textit{primitive} capability: protocell networks coordinating via boundary signals before genetic encoding existed.

The resulting ``code'' is not a transmitted message. It is a \textbf{shared interface}---a stable pattern that allows coordination without requiring each compartment to know the other's full internal state.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Decoding as Free Energy Minimization.} The ``decoder'' is not a separate apparatus---it is any neighboring compartment whose local phase space becomes constrained by the distributed coupling field. A compartment ``reads'' the code by minimizing its free energy relative to the boundary conditions imposed by its neighbors. The ``meaning'' of a symbol is the stability it induces in the receiver. Successful decoding is the transition to a coordination equilibrium.

\subsection{The Group-First Hypothesis}

A lone protocell faces a brutal tradeoff:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Too open $\to$ mixes with environment, loses identity
    \item Too closed $\to$ cannot exchange resources, stagnates
    \item Too complex $\to$ collapses into monopoly attractors
\end{itemize}

A \textbf{network of weakly coupled compartments} relaxes these constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Spatial heterogeneity becomes memory}: Different compartments occupy different internal states, but the network stabilizes a shared macrostate
    \item \textbf{Weak coupling enables coordination without collapse}: Too little coupling produces chaos; too much produces synchronization; intermediate coupling produces stable diversity \cite{strogatz2000kuramoto,pikovsky2001synchronization}
    \item \textbf{Selection can operate at the group level}: Network-level ``phenotypes'' (stable symbol regimes) persist and outcompete others
\end{enumerate}

This suggests early life was more likely a \textbf{coupled compartment network} than isolated protocells \cite{szostak2001synthesizing,chen2004emergence,adamski2020protocells}.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{The Interface IS the Organism.} Before internalization, ``life'' exists in the distributed coupling fields \textit{between} compartments---in the geometry of coordination, not in any single cell. Selection pressure forces individual compartments to internalize compressed models of this distributed dynamic, enabling prediction of neighbor behavior. \textbf{The genetic code is the crystallization of the ``between'' into the ``within.''}

\subsection{The Evolutionary Sequence}

Codes do not appear all at once. We propose a developmental sequence:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{clp{7cm}}
\toprule
Stage & What Exists & What ``Code'' Means \\
\midrule
0 & Coupled dynamics & No codes yet---just coordination \\
1 & Stable boundary symbols & Coordination equilibria: ``when I'm in state A, you respond with X'' \\
2 & Symbols label internal regimes & Proto-semantics: ``I'm UV-tolerant,'' ``I'm resource-hoarding'' \\
3 & Slow variables persist symbols & Message storage without genes---hysteresis, membrane composition \\
4 & Compression into templates & Genetic code as late optimization \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Key claim}: You learn to send messages before you learn to store them. Communication is primary; information storage is secondary \cite{szathmary1995major,michod1999darwinian,turchin2016ultrasociety}. Genes are not the origin of codes; they are a compression of codes that already existed as coordination interfaces.

\medskip
\noindent\textit{We hypothesize that there is no purely non-social form of life---that social game theory is not an emergent property of living systems but its foundation} \cite{axelrod1984evolution,nowak2006evolutionary,skyrms2004stag}. The deeper claim is stronger still: \textbf{nonliving systems can exhibit social dynamics}. Coupled oscillators ``negotiate'' stable phase relationships; competing catalysts ``cooperate'' via shared substrates; vesicle networks ``coordinate'' boundary states. These are not metaphors---they are the same game-theoretic structures that organize primate societies \cite{grueter2012multilevel}, now visible in chemistry because the math is substrate-independent. Life did not invent sociality; life is what happens when chemical sociality becomes heritable.

\subsection{Coherence Is Not Information}

A critical distinction underlies this framework:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
Coherence & Information \\
\midrule
High-dimensional phase order & Discrete symbols \\
Constraint, correlation, coordination capacity & Addressable, copyable, decodable tokens \\
The ability to move as a coupled whole & Something that can be reproduced across contexts \\
\textit{Not} information & Information \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The common category error in origin-of-life research is treating ``structured dynamics'' as ``encoded symbols.'' They are not the same.

\textbf{Coherence} enables coordination. \textbf{Information} is what emerges when coherent dynamics collapse into reproducible invariants---stable tokens that can be transmitted, stored, and decoded.

The bridge: \textit{codes form when coherence collapses into reproducible invariants}. This explains the apparent paradox: how can information arise from chemistry? Answer: it doesn't arise \textit{de novo}. Chemistry first produces coherent coordination; codes emerge when that coordination stabilizes into discrete, copyable forms.

\subsection{Intelligence as Ergodicity Defense}

Why would coupled compartments evolve toward higher-dimensional dynamics? Because \textbf{high-dimensional systems are harder to collapse}.

Define \textbf{ergodicity defense} as the ability to maintain history-dependent, non-equilibrium macrostates under perturbation. A system that forgets its past (ergodic) cannot coordinate. A system that remembers (non-ergodic) can maintain identity while adapting.

\textbf{Proposition}: Intelligence, in its most primitive form, is ergodicity defense---the maintenance of non-ergodic dynamics against entropic collapse \cite{friston2019free,england2013statistical,todd2026intelligence}.

High effective dimensionality serves this goal:
\begin{itemize}
    \item More internal directions to absorb perturbations without losing identity
    \item More reconfiguration paths for adaptation
    \item More orthogonal modes for coordination with neighbors
\end{itemize}

Selection pressure is not ``make a code'' or ``maximize yield.'' It is: \textbf{avoid collapse into ergodicity while remaining responsive to environment and neighbors.}

%==============================================================================
\section{Prebiotic Plausibility: Why Vesicles?}
\label{sec:vesicles}
%==============================================================================

Our model posits networks of coupled protocellular compartments as the substrate for code emergence. This section addresses whether such structures could have existed prebiotically, and why vesicles are the most plausible candidate.

\subsection{Evidence for Prebiotic Vesicle Formation}

Lipid vesicles form spontaneously under conditions consistent with early Earth:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Meteoritic delivery}: Amphiphilic molecules capable of forming membranes have been identified in carbonaceous chondrites, including the Murchison meteorite \cite{deamer2005chemistry,dworkin2001selfassembling}. These include fatty acids, alcohols, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with membrane-forming properties.

    \item \textbf{Hydrothermal synthesis}: Simulations of hydrothermal vent conditions produce amphiphilic molecules from simple precursors (CO$_2$, H$_2$) via Fischer-Tropsch-type reactions \cite{mccollom1999lipid,rushdi2001lipid}. Alkaline vents provide both the chemical gradients and the confined spaces conducive to protocell formation \cite{lane2010energetics,martin2008hydrothermal}.

    \item \textbf{Spontaneous assembly}: Above critical micelle concentrations, fatty acids spontaneously form bilayer vesicles in aqueous solution. Unlike phospholipids, short-chain fatty acids (C8--C12) form membranes that are permeable enough to allow exchange of small molecules while maintaining compartmentalization \cite{mansy2008model,budin2009expanding}.

    \item \textbf{Growth and division}: Szostak and colleagues have demonstrated that fatty acid vesicles can grow by incorporating additional amphiphiles from the environment and divide under mild shear forces---without enzymatic machinery \cite{zhu2009coupled,budin2011physical}. This provides a plausible pathway from chemistry to self-reproducing compartments.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Alternative Compartmentalization Substrates}

We acknowledge several alternative models for prebiotic compartmentalization:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lp{4.5cm}p{4.5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Substrate} & \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Limitations} \\
\midrule
Coacervates & Form spontaneously from polymers; concentrate molecules; Oparin's original model & No defined boundary; less structured; unclear heredity mechanism \\
\addlinespace
Hydrothermal vent pores & Mineral-catalyzed chemistry; natural gradients; fixed compartments & Geometry fixed by rock; cannot divide or evolve independently \\
\addlinespace
Mineral surfaces & Catalytic activity; template-capable (clays); concentrate reactants & Two-dimensional; no encapsulation; limited to surface chemistry \\
\addlinespace
Ice channels & Concentrate solutes via eutectic exclusion; stabilize polymers & Narrow temperature range; episodic availability \\
\addlinespace
Phase-separated droplets & Membraneless organelles exist in modern cells; form via liquid-liquid separation & No clear prebiotic formation pathway; less stable than vesicles \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Each substrate can provide compartmentalization, but they differ in whether they support the \textit{full set} of requirements for code emergence via coordination.

\subsection{Requirements for Coupled Compartment Dynamics}

Our framework requires compartments that satisfy five conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Spatial separation}: Distinct interior volumes that can maintain different chemical states.

    \item \textbf{Semi-permeability}: Boundaries that allow selective exchange of signals (ions, small molecules, electrical potentials) while retaining macromolecules and maintaining gradients.

    \item \textbf{Internal chemistry}: Capacity to support non-equilibrium reaction dynamics---the ``high-dimensional reservoir'' that generates complex internal states.

    \item \textbf{Neighbor coupling}: Physical contact or proximity enabling boundary-to-boundary signaling between adjacent compartments.

    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Ability to form extended networks (arrays, chains, clusters) where collective dynamics can emerge.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Vesicles uniquely satisfy all five requirements}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Spatial separation}: Bilayer membranes create distinct aqueous compartments.
    \item \textit{Semi-permeability}: Fatty acid membranes are permeable to small molecules and ions; membrane proteins (or prebiotic analogs) can create selective channels \cite{mansy2008model}.
    \item \textit{Internal chemistry}: Encapsulated reaction networks can operate far from equilibrium, driven by transmembrane gradients.
    \item \textit{Neighbor coupling}: Vesicles in contact can exchange signals via membrane fusion, hemifusion, gap junction-like connections, or diffusion through shared aqueous phases. Bioelectric signaling (voltage gradients across membranes) provides a fast coordination channel \cite{levin2021bioelectric}.
    \item \textit{Scalability}: Vesicles spontaneously form aggregates, chains, and two-dimensional arrays when concentrated on surfaces or in confined geometries \cite{karlsson2001networks,bolognesi2018sculpting}.
\end{itemize}

Coacervates satisfy (1), (3), and partially (2), but lack the structured boundaries needed for (4) and (5). Mineral pores satisfy (1)--(4) but fail (5)---they cannot form mobile, evolvable networks. Vesicles are the minimal prebiotic structure that supports the full coordination-to-code pathway.

\subsection{The Mechanism Is Substrate-Agnostic}

While we focus on vesicles for concreteness and experimental tractability, we emphasize that the \textit{mechanism}---codes emerging from coordination equilibria between coupled high-dimensional systems---is substrate-agnostic.

Any system satisfying the five requirements above could, in principle, generate symbolic communication via the pathway we describe:
\begin{quote}
Coupled dynamics $\to$ coordination equilibria $\to$ stable boundary symbols $\to$ compressed codes
\end{quote}

This generality is important: it means the transition from chemistry to codes is not contingent on a specific molecular implementation but emerges from \textit{geometric and dynamical constraints} on coupled compartments.

%==============================================================================
\section{Physical Architecture and Simulation}
\label{sec:architecture}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{System Components}

We implement a minimal version of the coupled-compartment architecture:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Component & Function & Implementation \\
\midrule
Compartments & Semi-autonomous agents & 61 vesicles in hexagonal array \\
Fast dynamics & Internal chemistry & 128 dimensions per compartment \\
Substrate competition & Emergent discretization & Lateral inhibition (30 channels) \\
Multi-channel coupling & Neighbor communication & Boundary signal exchange \\
Boundary readout & Symbol formation & Collective coordinates \\
Spatial heterogeneity & Symmetry breaking & Center-edge, top-bottom gradients \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{The Discretization Mechanism: Substrate Competition}

The critical innovation is \textbf{substrate competition}---a lateral inhibition mechanism where output channels compete for shared metabolic resources. This creates emergent discretization: continuous dynamics collapse into discrete attractor basins without external logic.

The mechanism uses standard biochemistry:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hill kinetics}: Saturation function with cooperativity ($n=2$)
    \item \textbf{Michaelis-Menten dynamics}: Substrate consumption and replenishment
    \item \textbf{Competitive allocation}: Each channel's output $\propto \text{activity}^n / \sum(\text{activity}^n)$
\end{itemize}

This allocation formula is the \textbf{quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA)} solution to competitive binding kinetics \cite{cornish2012fundamentals}. While the equation $a_i^h / \sum_j a_j^h$ mathematically resembles the ``Softmax'' function used in machine learning, it here arises from \textbf{conservation of mass}: the ``sum'' in the denominator happens \textit{physically} because the substrate pool depletes. When channel A grabs a molecule, channel B cannot have it. This competitive exclusion forces winner-take-most dynamics that discretize continuous states into stable binary outputs without programmed thresholds.

\subsection{Environmental Heterogeneity}

Each vesicle experiences spatially varying stimulus conditions (center-edge light gradients, top-bottom temperature gradients, left-right flow gradients), mimicking the spatial structure of real prebiotic environments like tidal pools or hydrothermal vent systems. \textit{Crucially, these represent non-informational geometric constraints}---a rock shading part of the pool, proximity to a heat source, differential ion exposure. The complexity is not in the stimulus; it is in the system's ability to differentiate continuous gradients into discrete coordination states. This breaks symmetry and increases the number of distinguishable coordination equilibria.

Additionally, \textbf{temporal forcing} creates genuine sequence structure. Each of 4 temporal cycles experiences different environmental conditions (modeling diurnal UV variation, tidal ion fluxes, temperature rhythms). This ensures the 4-symbol character sequence is a \textit{genuine temporal trajectory}, not merely the same symbol repeated.

\subsection{Simulation Results}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\toprule
Metric & Result \\
\midrule
Compartments & 61 vesicles (hexagonal array) \\
Internal dimensions per vesicle & 128 \\
Readout channels per vesicle & 30 \\
Unique input$\to$character mappings & 32/32 (no collisions) \\
Reproducibility & 100\% \\
Separation ratio (between/within) & 335,361$\times$ \\
Env--Attractor correlation & 0.72 \\
Decoder accuracy & 100\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent\textbf{Key findings}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Complete discrimination}: 32 input configurations map to 32 unique output sequences with no collisions. The network has sufficient capacity for full discrimination.
    \item \textbf{Emergent discretization}: 89\% of readout values are saturated ($|x| > 0.5$). The chemistry does the digitizing, not external logic.
    \item \textbf{Geometry preservation}: Environment--attractor correlation of 0.72 indicates that similar inputs map to similar outputs---the code preserves structure.
    \item \textbf{Physics decoder}: A second vesicle array (``receiver colony'') with identical dynamics achieves 100\% decoding accuracy without machine learning.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Robustness Across Random Seeds}

To rule out ``lucky initialization,'' we tested the system across 20 independent random seeds (different initial conditions, weight matrices, and coupling topologies):

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Mean $\pm$ SD} & \textbf{Range} \\
\midrule
Unique codes & $31.2 \pm 1.1$ & 28--32 \\
Separation ratio & $298,000 \pm 42,000$ & 210,000--380,000 \\
Reproducibility & $98.4\% \pm 2.1\%$ & 94--100\% \\
Decoder accuracy & $99.1\% \pm 1.3\%$ & 96--100\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent All 20 seeds produce functional codes with $\geq$28 unique mappings. The \textit{specific} symbol assignments vary (each seed discovers a different code), but the \textit{structural properties} (discretization, reproducibility, decodability) are robust. This demonstrates that code emergence is a generic property of the architecture, not a special case.

\subsection{The Physics Decoder}

The decoder is a \textbf{second vesicle array} that receives the encoder's output signal:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Receiver vesicles have the same mass-action dynamics as encoder vesicles
    \item They receive the encoder's 20-dimensional code signal (center + edge aggregates)
    \item They process this signal through their own reservoir dynamics
    \item Their output pattern is compared to canonical receiver patterns
\end{itemize}

This satisfies the Shannon structure: Environment $\to$ Encoder (vesicle array) $\to$ Message (code signal) $\to$ Decoder (receiver colony) $\to$ Distinguishable response.

The decoder demonstrates that the ``code'' is genuinely decodable by physics alone---no neural networks, no lookup tables, no machine learning.

%==============================================================================
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Abiogenesis: The ``Between'' Becoming ``Within''}

We propose that abiogenesis follows a three-phase trajectory:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 (The ``Between'')}: Coherence dynamics connect simple compartments via coupling fields. The ``code'' is volatile, living in the geometry of inter-compartment coordination---a distributed ``ghost'' in the electric/chemical fields between cells.

    \item \textbf{Phase 2 (The Pressure)}: To survive environmental fluctuations and predict neighbor behavior, a compartment must internalize a compressed model of the distributed field dynamics.

    \item \textbf{Phase 3 (The ``Within'')}: The compartment creates stable internal references (eventually RNA/DNA) to model the external field. This is the \textbf{Compression Transition}---the crystallization of ``between'' into ``within.''
\end{enumerate}

This explains why internal symbols match external signals without a designer: the internal code is a \textit{learned compression} of the coordination dynamics that already existed in the coupling fields. The genetic code is not the origin of meaning; it is the \textit{fossilization} of meaning that lived in the distributed state.

\subsection{The DNA-RNA-Protein System as Communication}

On this view, the DNA-RNA-protein system is literally a communication system---not metaphorically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DNA}: Persistent storage (slow, stable channel)
    \item \textbf{RNA}: Transmittable message (routing + control)
    \item \textbf{Protein}: Embodied actuation (receiver output)
\end{itemize}

But this is \textit{late} communication---the internalization of external protocols. The original ``messages'' were the coordination patterns in the coupling fields between protocells.

\subsection{Implications for Artificial Life}

Our framework suggests a recipe for artificial life: don't try to ``program'' life. Create bounded, high-dimensional, far-from-equilibrium systems with weak coupling and multiscale dynamics. Codes will emerge.

The key ingredients are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item High-dimensional internal dynamics (many coupled degrees of freedom)
    \item Weak coupling between compartments (influence without collapse)
    \item Multiple signaling channels (redundancy and temporal separation)
    \item Environmental heterogeneity (symmetry breaking)
    \item Substrate competition (emergent discretization)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Experimental Accessibility}

A practical advantage of the vesicle model is experimental tractability. Modern microfluidic techniques allow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fabrication of vesicle arrays with controlled topology \cite{karlsson2001networks}
    \item Loading with oscillatory chemistry (e.g., BZ reaction, glycolytic oscillators)
    \item Measurement of inter-vesicle coupling via fluorescence, pH indicators, or voltage-sensitive dyes
    \item Systematic variation of coupling strength, membrane composition, and network geometry
\end{itemize}

The predictions of our model---that coupled vesicle networks will spontaneously develop reproducible, discrete, decodable boundary patterns---are directly testable with existing laboratory techniques.

%==============================================================================
\section{Conclusion}
%==============================================================================

We have argued that symbolic codes first emerged as coordination interfaces between coupled protocellular compartments, not as transmitted messages requiring pre-existing machinery. The key mechanism is substrate competition, which discretizes continuous dynamics into stable symbols without external logic.

Our simulations demonstrate that networks of coupled compartments with high-dimensional internal dynamics reliably produce:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 32 unique symbol sequences from 32 environmental configurations
    \item 100\% reproducibility across trials
    \item 100\% decoder accuracy using physics alone
    \item Emergent discretization via mass-action kinetics
\end{itemize}

The deeper claim is that \textbf{communication precedes information storage}. Genes are not the origin of codes; they are the compression of codes that already existed as coordination equilibria in protocellular networks. Abiogenesis is the history of the ``between'' becoming the ``within''---life first exists in the distributed coupling fields, then internalizes those dynamics as genetic memory.

Life runs on coordination. The code is not a message. The code is a convention. And the genetic code is the fossilization of meaning that once lived in the electric fields between cells.
