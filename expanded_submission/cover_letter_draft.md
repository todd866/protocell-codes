# Cover Letter Draft - Discover Life

**Status:** DRAFT - needs refinement after paper expansion

Dear Editors,

We submit "From Chemistry to Ecology: Codes and Predation Emerge from Coherence Constraints in Protocell Networks" for consideration at Discover Life.

## Why This Journal

[TODO: Research recent DL papers and cite 2-3 that this connects to]

## The Core Contribution

We address two fundamental puzzles in abiogenesis:

1. **How did discrete codes arise from continuous chemistry?**
2. **Why didn't early life homogenize into synchronous goo?**

We propose both answers follow from the same physics: coherence constraints.

## Key Results

- **Code emergence:** Networks of 61 coupled compartments map 32 environmental configurations to 32 distinguishable codes with 98% accuracy
- **Mechanism:** Substrate competition (Hill kinetics, h>1) produces winner-take-most dynamics
- **Validation:** Lewis signaling games produce equivalent codes via different mechanism (coordination pressure alone)
- **Basin structure:** Degeneracy correlates with robustness (r=0.98), matching genetic code structure
- **Ecological dynamics:** Metabolic ceiling on coherence generates predator-prey dynamics without specialized machinery

## What's New (Compared to Prior Versions)

[TODO: List additions from Araudia work]

- Lewis signaling game validation
- Basin structure analysis connecting to genetic code
- P-adic formalism validation (Khrennikov 2024)
- Honest limitations section

## Engagement with OoL Literature

[TODO: Add after expanding paper]

We engage directly with:
- Autocatalytic sets (Kauffman)
- Hypercycle theory (Eigen)
- Metabolism-first perspectives (Branscomb)
- Recent ecological models (Baum, Peng)

## Limitations (Honest)

We are explicit about what the model does and does not explain:

| Explains | Does Not Explain |
|----------|------------------|
| WHY degeneracy is adaptive | Specific wobble structure (position 3) |
| WHY codes emerge from coordination | tRNA/ribosome chemistry |
| WHY ecological differentiation | Specific prebiotic chemistry |

## Availability

- Code: [GitHub link]
- Companion preprints: [arXiv links]

We believe this work offers a novel perspective on the relationship between codes, ecology, and the origin of life, and would generate productive discussion in the OoL community.

Sincerely,
