Dear [Editors / Prize Committee],

We submit "From Chemistry to Ecology: Codes and Predation Emerge from Coherence Constraints in Protocell Networks" for consideration.

## The Core Questions

We address two fundamental puzzles in abiogenesis that your [call / prize] explicitly identifies:

1. **How did discrete codes arise from continuous chemistry?**
   - The genetic code is symbolic—arbitrary mappings from codons to amino acids. Where did this symbolic structure come from?

2. **Where did the information in DNA come from?** (Evolution 2.0 question)
   - We propose: codes originated not for intracellular replication but for intercellular coordination.

## Our Mechanism

**Substrate competition** via cooperative binding (Hill kinetics, h > 1) produces discrete output attractors from continuous input gradients. This is:
- Prebiotically plausible (uses only chemistry, no genetic machinery)
- Mechanism-independent (validated through Lewis signaling games)
- Connected to actual genetic code structure (basin analysis, p-adic validation)

## Key Results

| Finding | Quantification |
|---------|----------------|
| Code emergence | 32 environments → 32 distinguishable codes |
| Decoding accuracy | 98% (physics only, no ML) |
| Lewis game validation | Independent mechanism, same outcome |
| Basin-robustness | r = 0.80 ± 0.08 (n=20) |
| P-adic validation | 30/32 closest pairs code same AA |
| Predator-prey | Emerges from coherence ceiling |

## What's Novel

1. **Codes before genes**: We show symbolic structure can exist *between* compartments before being internalized within them. This breaks the circularity that has plagued code origin theories.

2. **Two independent validations**: Substrate competition (chemistry) and Lewis signaling (game theory) produce equivalent codes. Code emergence is *generic*, not mechanism-specific.

3. **Connection to actual genetic code**: Basin structure analysis shows degeneracy correlates with robustness (r = 0.80 ± 0.08 across 20 seeds). P-adic analysis validates Khrennikov's formalism (30/32 closest codon pairs map to same amino acid).

4. **Honest limitations**: We explicitly state what our model does NOT explain—the concentration of degeneracy at position 3 (wobble) requires tRNA/ribosome chemistry, not just dynamics.

## Engagement with OoL Literature

We engage directly with major frameworks:
- Autocatalytic sets (Kauffman): We extend to coordination, not just catalysis
- Hypercycle theory (Eigen): We operate upstream—before coded molecules exist
- Metabolism-first (Branscomb): We incorporate thermodynamic disequilibrium
- Ecological OoL (Baum, Peng): We provide specific mechanisms for their framework

## Why This Matters

If correct, this framework suggests:
1. Ecological dynamics predate genetic encoding
2. Predator-prey structure is physical, not biological
3. Code complexity increases via arms-race dynamics (complexity ratchet)

These claims are testable: coupled vesicle arrays with oscillatory chemistry should spontaneously develop reproducible discrete boundary states.

## For Evolution 2.0 Prize Specifically

This work directly addresses your core question: "Where did the information in DNA come from?"

Our answer: **Codes emerged as coordination equilibria between coupled compartments.** The symbolic structure that became the genetic code originated for intercellular signaling, not intracellular replication. Information is not primary—coherence is primary, and information emerges when coherent dynamics collapse into reproducible invariants.

This is testable, falsifiable, and connected to existing experimental platforms (microfluidic vesicle arrays, oscillatory chemistry).
