# Communication Beyond Information

**Core claim**: When high-dimensional coherent systems couple, they exchange constraints rather than tokens. This can create new collective coordinates, increasing effective dimensionality beyond the sum of parts.

## The Key Distinction

| Coherence | Information |
|-----------|-------------|
| High-D phase order | Discrete symbols |
| Constraint, correlation | Addressable, copyable tokens |
| Coordination capacity | Decodable distinctions |
| **Not** information | Information |

**The bridge**: Codes form when coherence collapses into reproducible invariants.

## Why Information Bounds Fail

Standard information theory assumes a **fixed statistical manifold**. Communication is motion on that manifold. Complexity growth is bounded by mutual information.

But when high-D systems couple:
- The manifold itself expands
- New collective coordinates appear
- Complexity can grow faster than info bounds predict

This is **manifold expansion**: communication as manifold deformation, not message passing.

## The Sequencing Claim

```
External communication → Internal communication
```

Before a system can "talk to itself" (DNA/RNA/protein), it must coordinate with others. The earliest selective pressures are external.

**Developmental pathway**:
1. Coupling mechanisms (phase-locking, membrane exchange)
2. Shared conventions (repeatable interaction motifs)
3. Tokenization (motifs become discrete objects)
4. Internal memory (token set becomes storable → genetic stack)

## Testable Predictions

1. **Superlinear complexity scaling** with group size
2. **Phase transitions** when coupling crosses thresholds
3. **History dependence** in interacting colonies
4. **Compression follows expansion**: codes appear after stable collective modes
