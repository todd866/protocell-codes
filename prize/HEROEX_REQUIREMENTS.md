# HeroX Evolution 2.0 Prize - Official Requirements

**Prize:** $10,000,000 USD ($100k initial + $10M if patentable)
**Sponsor:** Natural Code LLC
**Judges:** George Church (Harvard/MIT), Denis Noble (Oxford)

## The Challenge

Discover a purely chemical process that will generate, transmit and receive a simple code—a process by which chemicals self-organize into a code without benefit of designer.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Communication System Structure
Must have three integral components (per Shannon 1948):
- **Encoder** → produces message
- **Message** → sequence of symbols
- **Decoder** → processes message

### 2. Digital, Not Analog
The system must be digital. A system that merely transmits vibrations or energy conversions is not acceptable.

### 3. Symbol/Character Structure (Two-Layer)
- **Symbol**: group of k bits considered as a unit
- **Character**: group of n symbols considered as a unit
- **Requirement**: n + k ≥ 5 (must represent at least 32 digital states)

### 4. Encoding/Decoding Tables
- Must provide tables filled with values from the submitted system
- Must be objectively determinable whether encoding/decoding was correct
- Input must correspond to output (like keyboard → screen, but emergent)

### 5. No Pre-Programming
- Humans may design the experiment and lab conditions
- The actual system may NOT be preprogrammed with any code
- Any preprogrammed code = automatic disqualification

### 6. No Biological Material
- May not be directly from any living organism, virus, or similar
- No bee waggles, dog barks, RNA strands derived from cells, mating calls, etc.
- RNA that forms spontaneously from non-living chemicals (like glycolaldehyde) IS acceptable
- Must show results are not contaminated by pre-existing biological material
- Detection of such materials = automatic disqualification

### 7. Observable/Reproducible
Origin of system must be:
- Observable in nature, OR
- Duplicable in real-world laboratory according to scientific method

## What They're Looking For

> "A process where some chemicals, at some particular concentration of compounds, at the right temperature and pressure, etc. generate, transmit and receive a simple code, without any intelligent being or other life-form creating, transmitting or receiving the code."

> "Chemicals alone, without the benefit of minds or brains belonging to humans or the assistance of other living things, have built a simple communication system from scratch."

> "The jar of chemicals on its own would be assigning meaning to symbols."

## Submission Requirements

- Maximum 20 pages
- Single unlocked PDF, 20 MB max
- English only
- May include embedded hyperlinks to videos (max 2 min)
- Must sign NDA before submission accepted for review

## Prize Structure

| Milestone | Prize |
|-----------|-------|
| Initial award (meets all criteria) | $100,000 USD |
| Viable US patent granted | $10,000,000 USD + equity |

## Disqualification Triggers

1. Preprogrammed code in any form
2. Biological material or derivatives
3. Analog (not digital) system
4. < 32 distinguishable states
5. No encoder/decoder structure
6. Cannot objectively verify correct transmission

## Key Quotes

> "We are looking for entries that offer quantifiable technological progress."

> "General essays presenting a 'Theory Of Everything' and metaphysical constructions about the history of life, unfortunately, cannot be considered."
